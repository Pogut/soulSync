SoulSync is an emotionally adaptive mental-wellness prototype designed to explore how empathetic AI interaction, journaling, and self-reflection tools can improve users’ perceived emotional support, trust, and comfort.  
The project is developed as part of **SOEN 357 – User Interface Design (Fall 2025)** at Concordia University.

Unlike traditional wellness apps that rely on static prompts or predefined responses, SoulSync focuses on adaptive emotional interaction, allowing the system to respond more sensitively to users’ emotional states over time.

## Problem Statement

In today’s fast-paced and emotionally demanding environment, many mental-wellness applications fail to maintain long-term engagement. Research shows that users often abandon these apps because they feel robotic, emotionally detached, or non-empathetic.

Most existing solutions:
- Provide one-size-fits-all responses  
- Lack emotional adaptivity  
- Do not evolve with the user’s emotional patterns  

SoulSync addresses this gap by introducing an emotionally adaptive AI companion that learns from users’ interactions, journals, and emotional patterns to deliver a more human-centered experience.

---

## Research Goal

**Research Question:**  
Does an AI-powered journaling companion that adapts its tone to the user’s mood increase users’ perceived empathy and emotional support compared to non-adaptive journaling apps?

**Hypothesis:**  
Users interacting with an emotionally adaptive AI companion will experience higher perceived empathy, trust, and comfort than users of traditional non-adaptive wellness applications.

This project serves as a design probe to study affective computing, emotional design, and trust in human-AI interaction.

## Core Features

### Lumi: The AI Companion
Lumi is the emotional core of SoulSync. Designed to emulate empathetic therapeutic behavior, Lumi adapts its tone and conversational style based on user input and emotional context.

Lumi supports:
- Active listening  
- Emotion-aware responses  
- Gentle guidance or comfort depending on user needs  

You can see the Lumi chat interface in the screenshot below.

### Chat Modes: Guided and Free Flow

SoulSync offers two distinct conversational modes to support different emotional needs.

#### Guided Flow
- Lumi initiates the conversation with reflective questions  
- Helps users clarify emotional intent  
- Leads to either comfort-focused or solution-oriented interactions  

#### Free Flow
- Fully open-ended conversation  
- User leads the dialogue  
- Designed to feel like speaking to a supportive companion without constraints  

You can see the chat selection and free-flow chat interfaces in the screenshots below.

### Guided Breathing Exercises

When stress or anxiety is detected, or manually selected by the user, SoulSync provides guided breathing exercises designed to promote calmness and grounding.

The breathing experience combines:
- Visual rhythm cues  
- Timed inhale, hold, and exhale cycles  
- Minimal interaction to reduce cognitive load  

You can see the breathing exercise interface in the screenshot below.

### Journaling and Reflection

SoulSync encourages daily journaling as a tool for emotional awareness and self-reflection.

Users can:
- Write free-form journal entries  
- Respond to daily reflection prompts  
- Review past entries organized by date and emotional tone  

Journaling supports Lumi’s contextual understanding and helps identify emotional patterns over time.

You can see the journal overview page in the screenshot below.

## Design Philosophy

SoulSync is grounded in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles, particularly:

- Emotional Design (Norman, 2004)  
- Affective Computing (Picard, 1997)  
- Empathic Interaction Design (Kouprie & Visser, 2009)  

The interface prioritizes:
- Calm visual language  
- Soft animations and transitions  
- Mobile-first, phone-like layout  
- Minimal cognitive overload  

The goal is not clinical diagnosis, but emotional presence, comfort, and trust.

## Technology and Scope

This repository contains a front-end prototype only, built with:
- HTML  
- Tailwind CSS  
- Minimal JavaScript for navigation and state simulation  

No backend or real AI processing is implemented at this stage.  
All AI behavior is conceptual and design-driven, aligned with the academic scope of SOEN 357.

---

## Project Status

- Research and objectives completed  
- High-fidelity UI prototype implemented  
- Core interaction flows connected  
- User evaluation and usability testing pending  

---

## Academic Context

This project is part of **SOEN 357 – User Interface Design** and contributes to research on:
- Trust in AI systems  
- Emotional adaptivity in interfaces  
- Long-term engagement in wellness applications  

All design decisions are informed by the submitted proposal and research documentation.

## Disclaimer

SoulSync is a research and design prototype.  
It is not a medical or therapeutic substitute.  
Users experiencing severe emotional distress should seek professional help.
